## üì• Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "dbviewer", group: :development
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

## üîß Usage

Mount the engine in your application's `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Your application routes...

  # Mount the DBViewer engine
  mount Dbviewer::Engine, at: "/dbviewer"
  # The engine can be mounted in any environment when using Basic Authentication
end
```

Configure Basic Authentication in an initializer to secure access (strongly recommended):

```ruby
# config/initializers/dbviewer.rb
Dbviewer.configure do |config|
  config.admin_credentials = {
    username: "your_username",
    password: "your_secure_password"
  }
end
```

Then, visit `/dbviewer` in your browser to access the database viewer. You'll be prompted for your username and password.

### Rails API-only Applications

If you're using a Rails API-only application (created with `--api` flag), you'll need to enable the Flash middleware for DBViewer to work properly. Add the following to your `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
module YourApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ... existing configuration

    # Required for DBViewer flash messages
    config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Flash
  end
end
```

This is necessary because API-only Rails applications don't include the Flash middleware by default, which DBViewer uses for displaying notifications.

### Available Pages

- **Dashboard** (`/dbviewer`): Comprehensive overview with database statistics and analytics
- **Tables Index** (`/dbviewer/tables`): Shows all tables in your database with column counts and quick access
- **Table Details** (`/dbviewer/tables/:table_name`): Shows table structure and records with pagination
- **SQL Query** (`/dbviewer/tables/:table_name/query`): Allows running custom SQL queries
- **ERD View** (`/dbviewer/entity_relationship_diagrams`): Interactive Entity Relationship Diagram of your database
- **SQL Query Logs** (`/dbviewer/logs`): View and analyze logged SQL queries with performance metrics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

You can configure DBViewer by using our generator to create an initializer in your application:

```bash
rails generate dbviewer:initializer
```

This will create a file at `config/initializers/dbviewer.rb` with the default configuration:

```ruby
# config/initializers/dbviewer.rb
Dbviewer.configure do |config|
  config.per_page_options = [10, 20, 50, 100, 250]  # Default pagination options
  config.default_per_page = 20                       # Default records per page
  config.max_query_length = 10000                    # Maximum SQL query length
  config.cache_expiry = 300                          # Cache expiration in seconds
  config.max_records = 10000                         # Maximum records to return in any query
  config.enable_data_export = false                  # Whether to allow data exporting
  config.query_timeout = 30                          # SQL query timeout in seconds

  # Query logging options
  config.enable_query_logging = false                # Enable or disable query logging completely (default: true)
  config.query_logging_mode = :memory                # Storage mode for SQL queries (:memory or :file)
  config.query_log_path = "log/dbviewer.log"         # Path for query log file when in :file mode
  config.max_memory_queries = 1000                   # Maximum number of queries to store in memory

  # Authentication options
  # config.admin_credentials = { username: "admin", password: "your_secure_password" } # Basic HTTP auth credentials
end
```

You can also create this file manually if you prefer.

The configuration is accessed through `Dbviewer.configuration` throughout the codebase. You can also access it via `Dbviewer.config` which is an alias for backward compatibility.

## ü™µ Query Logging

DBViewer includes a powerful SQL query logging system that captures and analyzes database queries. You can access this log through the `/dbviewer/logs` endpoint. The logging system offers two storage backends:

### Disabling Query Logging

You can completely disable query logging if you don't need this feature:

```ruby
config.enable_query_logging = false       # Disable query logging completely
```

### In-Memory Storage (Default)

By default, queries are stored in memory. This provides fast access but queries are lost when the application restarts:

```ruby
config.query_logging_mode = :memory       # Store queries in memory (default)
config.max_memory_queries = 1000          # Maximum number of queries stored
```

### File-Based Storage

For persistent logging across application restarts, you can use file-based storage:

```ruby
config.query_logging_mode = :file         # Store queries in a log file
config.query_log_path = "log/dbviewer.log" # Path where query log file will be stored
```

The file format uses one JSON entry per line, making it easy to analyze with standard tools.

## üîí Security Features

DBViewer includes several security features to protect your database:

- **Read-only Mode**: Only SELECT queries are allowed; all data modification operations are blocked
- **SQL Validation**: Prevents potentially harmful operations with comprehensive validation
- **Query Limits**: Automatic LIMIT clause added to prevent excessive data retrieval
- **Pattern Detection**: Detection of SQL injection patterns and suspicious constructs
- **Error Handling**: Informative error messages without exposing sensitive information
- **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Protect access with username and password authentication

### Basic Authentication

You can enable HTTP Basic Authentication to secure access to DBViewer:

```ruby
Dbviewer.configure do |config|
  config.admin_credentials = {
    username: "your_username",
    password: "your_secure_password"
  }
end
```

When credentials are provided, all DBViewer routes will be protected by HTTP Basic Authentication.
Without valid credentials, users will be prompted for a username and password before they can access any DBViewer page.

## üå± Production Access

With the addition of Basic Authentication, DBViewer can now be used in any environment including production. We recommend the following for production deployments:

1. **Always** enable HTTP Basic Authentication with strong credentials:

   ```ruby
   Dbviewer.configure do |config|
     config.admin_credentials = {
       username: "unique_username",
       password: SecureRandom.hex(16)  # Generate a strong random password
     }
   end
   ```

2. Mount the engine in your routes file:

   ```ruby
   # In any environment, with Basic Auth protection
   mount Dbviewer::Engine, at: "/dbviewer"
   ```

3. Access the tool through your regular application URL:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/dbviewer?override_env_check=your_secure_random_key
   ```

## üìù Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This engine provides direct access to your database contents, which contains sensitive information. Always protect it with HTTP Basic Authentication by configuring strong credentials as shown above.

When used in production, ensure:

- You use long, randomly generated passwords (e.g., with `SecureRandom.hex(16)`)
- You access DBViewer over HTTPS connections only
- Access is limited to trusted administrators only

## üîÑ Updating DBViewer

To keep DBViewer up to date with the latest features, security patches, and bug fixes, follow these steps:

### Using Bundler

The simplest way to update is using Bundler:

- Update your Gemfile with the desired version:

  ```ruby
  # For the latest version
  gem "dbviewer", group: :development

  # Or specify a version
  gem "dbviewer", "~> 0.3.2", group: :development
  ```

- Run bundle update:

  ```ruby
  bundle update dbviewer
  ```

- Restart your Rails server to apply the changes:

  ```ruby
